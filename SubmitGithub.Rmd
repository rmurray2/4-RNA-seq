Following the tutorial [Creating Project Pages using the command line](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-project-pages-using-the-command-line)

[few git commands](https://dont-be-afraid-to-commit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/commandlinegit.html)

# Update the website

## List the changes

```{bash eval=FALSE}
cd 4-RNA-seq

## Check the active brunch
git branch
## * gh-pages
#   master

# if it is not "gh-pages" 
git checkout  'gh-pages'
```


```{bash eval=FALSE}
git status
# On branch gh-pages
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
# 	modified:   index.html
# 	modified:   search_index.json

```

These changes will only be applied to this branch when they’re committed. You can 'git add' changed files, but until you commit they won’t belong to any particular branch.

## Stage your changes
```{bash eval=FALSE}
# You can do git add -u so that it will stage the modified and deleted files.
git add -u
```

## Commit your changes

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git commit -m "Updating title"
git push origin gh-pages
```
